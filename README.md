This repository contains a Swift code example demonstrating an unexpected crash when using a guard statement with a negative function parameter. The `bug.swift` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the implicit unwrapping of a potentially negative integer. The solution demonstrates safer handling of the potential error.
